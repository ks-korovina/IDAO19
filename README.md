# IDAO19. 28th place.

Solution from team GroupbyExperts (Serge Shirobokov, Alexander Pukhov, Ksenia Korovina)

1) first change PATH it utils.py and load csv files there. Moreover, you may need to concat part 1 and 2 first or load functions from utils will not work.

2) Run hits_for_test notebook. It is slightly changed version of initial function but without a bug/typo...

3) Rin xgboost solution. 


Note: The solution here is our solution for train (28th place). It should be ~25-28 for test, too,  but we submitted incorrect version of csv file. (Well, you can check that this solution gives quality of public test submission and way better than our private test submission -- we did not overfit, just made stupid submission mistake in the last minute.)

You can contact me (a.m.pukhov@gmail.com) if you have any question or the code is not running, I will quickly fix it.
